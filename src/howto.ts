// run tsc index.ts and it will spit out a index.js
// tsc --init will generate a tsconfig.json file, you
// can specify src and build dir's and then just run
// tsc instead of tsc index.ts, or tsc -w will recompile
// on own instead of having to continue to run tsc
// then to run it you could open a separate terminal and run node build/index.js
// or can install nodemon to execute code and concurrently to help execute more than 1 script at a time
// npm init -y to get package.json and then you can add start scripts to help
